## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way for AI assistants to access tools outside their normal capabilities. With Fingertip's MCP implementation, AI assistants can:

- See all your Fingertip sites
- Get details about specific sites
- Create new sites

Think of it as giving the AI a set of commands to work with your Fingertip account.

## Getting Your API Key

Get your API key from [fingertip.com/account/api](https://fingertip.com/account/api). Log in, generate a key, and use it during setup. Keep it secure.

## Installation
