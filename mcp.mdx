## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants to interact with your Fingertip sites. Through this integration, AI assistants can view, manage, and create sites within your Fingertip account.

## Getting your API key

Get your API key from [fingertip.com/api-keys](https://fingertip.com/api-keys). Log in, generate a key, and use it during setup. Keep it secure.

### Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Local MCP Server

1. Install your preferred MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, OpenAI, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed etc.)
2. Locate your client's configuration file or settings area
   - Many clients use JSON configuration files in user directories
   - Refer to your specific client's documentation for exact locations
3. Add the Fingertip MCP server configuration (example for JSON-based clients):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "fingertip_api": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "fingertip-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "FINGERTIP_API_KEY": "Your_API_Key_Here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Restart your client application
5. Verify the connection by asking about your Fingertip sites

#### Option 2: Remote MCP Server

If you prefer not to run a local MCP server, you can use our remote MCP server:

1. Configure your MCP client to connect to the remote server (example for JSON-based clients):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "fingertip_api": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.fingertip.com/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Restart your client application
3. When using your client, you'll be prompted to authenticate in a browser window
4. After authentication, the Fingertip tools will be available to your AI assistant
5. Verify the connection by asking about your Fingertip sites

### Troubleshooting

- If using the remote server option, make sure you've completed the authentication in the browser
- For remote connections, you can test the connection directly with: `npx mcp-remote https://mcp.fingertip.com/sse`
- If authentication issues persist, try clearing cached credentials with: `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth`
- Restart Claude Desktop if tools aren't appearing
- Verify your API key is correct (for local server option)
