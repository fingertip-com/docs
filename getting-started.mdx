## Base URL

The Fingertip API is built on **REST** principles and enforces **HTTPS** for all requests to ensure data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://ap1-production-creator-api.fingertip.com
```

## Authentication

To authenticate with the Fingertip API, add an `Authorization` header to your requests. Your API key should be included directly in the header value. You can obtain an API key from [https://fingertip.com/account/api](https://fingertip.com/account/api).

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Response Codes

Fingertip uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests:

| Status | Description                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Successful request                                               |
| `400`  | Bad request - check that the parameters were correct             |
| `401`  | Unauthorized - API key is missing or invalid                     |
| `403`  | Forbidden - insufficient permissions for the requested operation |
| `404`  | Not found - the requested resource doesn't exist                 |
| `429`  | Too many requests - rate limit exceeded                          |
| `5xx`  | Server error - indicates a problem with Fingertip servers        |

## Rate Limits

Fingertip API implements rate limiting to ensure service stability. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429` response error code. Contact support if you need increased limits for your use case.

## Endpoints

### Health Check

You can verify your API connectivity with a simple ping request:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url https://ap1-production-creator-api.fingertip.com/api/v1/ping \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

A successful response indicates that your API key is valid and the service is available.
