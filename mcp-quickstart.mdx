## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way for AI assistants to access tools outside their normal capabilities. With Fingertip's MCP implementation, AI assistants can:

- See all your Fingertip sites
- Get details about specific sites
- Create new sites
  Think of it as giving the AI a set of commands to work with your Fingertip account.

## Installation

Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @fingertip/mcp
```

Or use Smithery for automatic setup with Claude:

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @fingertip-com/fingertip-mcp --client claude
```

## Quick Start

1. Set your API key:

```bash
export FINGERTIP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Start the MCP server:

```bash
fingertip-mcp
```

That's it! Now when you chat with an AI assistant, it can access your Fingertip sites.

## Setting up with Claude Desktop

To use Fingertip MCP with Claude Desktop:

1. **Install Claude Desktop** if you haven't already (available for macOS and Windows)

2. **Install Fingertip MCP** using one of these methods:

   **Method 1: Automatic setup with Smithery (recommended)**

   ```bash
   npx -y @smithery/cli install @fingertip-com/fingertip-mcp --client claude
   ```

   This automatically configures everything for Claude.

   **Method 2: Manual setup**

   ```bash
   # Install the package
   npm install -g @fingertip/mcp

   # Start the MCP server in a terminal
   FINGERTIP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here fingertip-mcp
   ```

3. **Open Claude Desktop** and you'll see "Fingertip" in the available tools section

4. **Verify it's working** by asking Claude "What Fingertip sites do I have?"

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Make sure the MCP server is running when using Claude
   - Restart Claude Desktop if tools aren't appearing
   - Check your API key is correct
