## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way for AI assistants to access tools outside their normal capabilities. With Fingertip's MCP implementation, AI assistants can:

- See all your Fingertip sites
- Get details about specific sites
- Create new sites

Think of it as giving the AI a set of commands to work with your Fingertip account.

## Getting Your API Key

Get your API key from [fingertip.com/account/api](https://fingertip.com/account/api). Log in, generate a key, and use it during setup. Keep it secure.

## Setting up with AI assistants

### Claude Desktop

To use Fingertip MCP with Claude Desktop:

1. **Install Claude Desktop** if you haven't already (available for macOS and Windows)
2. **Install Fingertip MCP** with Smithery:
   ```bash
   npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @fingertip-com/fingertip-mcp --client claude
   ```
````

3. **Open Claude Desktop** and you'll see "Fingertip" in the available tools section
4. **Verify it's working** by asking Claude "What Fingertip sites do I have?"
5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Make sure the MCP server is running when using Claude
   - Restart Claude Desktop if tools aren't appearing
   - Check your API key is correct

### Cursor

To use Fingertip MCP with Cursor:

1. **Install Cursor** if you haven't already
2. **Install Fingertip MCP** with Smithery:
   ```bash
   npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @fingertip-com/fingertip-mcp --client cursor
   ```
3. **Open Cursor** and the Fingertip tools will be available
4. **Verify it's working** by asking Cursor about your Fingertip sites
5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Ensure the MCP server is running when using Cursor
   - Restart Cursor if tools don't appear
   - Verify your API key is correctly configured

### Direct Configuration with npx

You can also manually set up Fingertip MCP by configuring your AI assistant's tools JSON directly:

1. Add the following configuration to your assistant's tools configuration file:
   ```json
   {
     "fingertip-mcp": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "@fingertip/mcp"],
       "env": {
         "FINGERTIP_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Fingertip API key
3. Restart your AI assistant for changes to take effect
