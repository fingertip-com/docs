## What are webhooks?

Webhooks push notifications to your application when events occur in Fingertip, like new bookings, form submissions, or orders.

## Getting started

1. **Create an endpoint** in your application that accepts POST requests
2. **Register your webhook** in the Fingertip dashboard
3. **Verify webhook signatures** using your secret key

## Verifying webhook signatures

**Why verify?** To ensure requests are actually from Fingertip and haven't been tampered with.

**How it works:**

1. Fingertip signs each webhook with your secret
2. Your server recreates and compares this signature
3. If they match, the webhook is legitimate

## Example implementation

```js
import express from "express";
import crypto from "crypto";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/webhooks", (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers["x-webhook-signature"];
  if (
    !verifySignature(
      JSON.stringify(req.body),
      signature,
      process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    )
  ) {
    return res.status(401).send("Invalid signature");
  }

  const { event, data } = req.body;
  console.log(`Received ${event}:`, data);
  res.status(200).end();

  // Process event asynchronously here...
  // handleEvent(event, data);
});

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest("hex");
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(expected));
}

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Webhook server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Supported events

| Event                   | Description          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| `booking.created`       | New booking created  |
| `booking.rescheduled`   | Booking time changed |
| `booking.cancelled`     | Booking cancelled    |
| `order.created`         | New order placed     |
| `form_response.created` | New form submission  |
| `site_contact.created`  | New site contact     |

## Best practices

- Respond to webhooks quickly with a 200 status code
- Process webhook data asynchronously
- Always verify webhook signatures
- Implement idempotency to handle duplicate events
